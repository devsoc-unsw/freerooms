                Unfortunately, as a student society we aren&apos;t able to make

                <br />
                <br />
                Use the &apos;Make a Booking&apos; button on the individual room
                pages to be redirected to the appropriate portals or contacts
                for bookings.

                While Freerooms can tell you anything you want to know about
                when a room is booked, there isn&apos;t much we can do if a
                person decides to take an unbooked room.
                <br />
                <br />
                To make sure <i>you</i> are this person, keep an eye out for
                rooms marked &apos;Available Soon&apos; and get in there before
                anyone else can!

              <>
                Freerooms currently only displays rooms managed by the UNSW
                Timetabling team, and library rooms.
                <br />
                <br />
                Other rooms (such as those booked through Outlook) are not yet
                supported, but we&apos;re actively exploring ways to integrate
                additional data sources, so stay tuned for future updates!

                The team have put their all into creating a responsive web app
                for seamless desktop and mobile experiences. <br />
                <br />
                But that&apos;s not all â€” as a first for DevSoc, we are
                currently in the active development phase of an exciting new
                mobile app for Freerooms. Stay tuned for future updates!
